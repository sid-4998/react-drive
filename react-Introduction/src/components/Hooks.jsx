// Hooks allow react functional components to have access to state and 
// other react features without using classes.
// 3 rules to keep in mind while defining Hooks
// * Hooks can only be used inside react functional components and not class components
// * Hooks can only be called at the top of the react functional component
// * Hooks cannot be used conditionally

// The useState Hook
// The react useState Hook allows us track state in a functional component
// State generally refers to data or properties that may change over time
// State is used to store and manage data over time
